## ✨ Features

- 📁 **Auto Categorization** — Sorts files into folders by type (images, code, documents, etc.)
- 🔁 **Duplicate File Handling** — Renames duplicates safely without overwriting anything
- 📂 **Auto Folder Creation** — Creates category folders automatically if they don't exist
- 🤖 **AI-Powered Unknown Extensions** — Uses Groq LLM to decide the best folder for unrecognized file types and remembers them for next time
- ↩️ **Undo Support** — Reverse the last organize operation with a single flag
- 📝 **Logging** — Every file move is recorded in `log.txt` for full transparency
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** — Pure Python, minimal dependencies

## 🆕 What's New

### v1.2 — Undo Support *(Latest)*
- New `--undo` flag to reverse the last organize operation
- All file moves are logged in `source->destination` format for accurate reversal
- Safely skips malformed or empty log lines

### v1.1 — AI Support for Unknown Extensions
- Unknown file extensions are now handled by **Groq LLM** — it decides the best folder name
- New extension-to-folder mappings are **saved back to `data.json`** automatically so the AI is only called once per extension
- Improved logging captures AI-assisted decisions separately

### v1.0 — Initial Release
- Core file organization by extension
- Auto folder creation
- Duplicate file safety with rename logic
- Basic logging

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) (free)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UnKnown-4656/FileOrganizer.git
cd FileOrganizer
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set Your API Key

On Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
$env:GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

On Mac/Linux:
```bash
export GROQ_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

---

## 🛠️ Usage

```bash
python main.py <folder_path>
```

**Organize:**
```bash
python main.py C:\Users\user\Desktop\MessyFolder
```

**Undo last organize:**
```bash
python main.py C:\Users\user\Desktop\MessyFolder --undo
```

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
📁 Messy Folder
├── photo.jpg        →   📁 images/
├── report.pdf       →   📁 documents/
├── script.py        →   📁 code/
├── song.mp3         →   📁 music/
└── unknown.xyz      →   🤖 Groq decides → 📁 misc/
```

1. Scans all files in the target folder (top level)
2. Looks up each file extension in `data.json`
3. If extension is unknown → asks Groq LLM for the best folder name → saves it to `data.json`
4. Creates destination folder if it doesn't exist
5. Moves the file safely, renaming if a duplicate exists
6. Logs every action to `log.txt`
7. Run with `--undo` to reverse all moves from the log

## 📂 Supported File Types

Built-in mappings are stored in `data.json`. Default categories include:

| Category   | Extensions                                                  |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Images     | `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.bmp`, `.svg`, `.webp`   |
| Videos     | `.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`, `.mov`, `.wmv`, `.flv`             |
| Music      | `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.aac`, `.ogg`                    |
| Documents  | `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.doc`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`, `.pptx`          |
| Archives   | `.zip`, `.rar`, `.tar`, `.gz`, `.7z`                       |
| Code       | `.py`, `.js`, `.html`, `.css`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.cs`      |
| Unknown    | Anything else → **handled by Groq AI** 🤖                  |

## 🤖 AI Support for Unknown Extensions

When FileOrganizer encounters a file with an unrecognized extension, it sends the extension to **Groq's LLM** which returns an appropriate folder name.

That mapping is then **saved permanently to `data.json`** — so the next time the same extension appears, no API call is needed.

```
Unknown extension: .blend
Groq response: { "extension": ".blend", "folder_name": "design_files" }
Saved to data.json ✓
```

> Requires a valid `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable.

---

## 📝 Logging

All operations are recorded in `log.txt`:

```
C:\Desktop\MessyFolder\photo.jpg->C:\Desktop\MessyFolder\images\photo.jpg
C:\Desktop\MessyFolder\report.pdf->C:\Desktop\MessyFolder\documents\report.pdf
```

Each line follows `source->destination` format, used by the `--undo` flag to reverse moves.
